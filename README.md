##Hi!
The idea behind the “Apple I” personal computer was proposed to HP by one it's employees (Woz) and dismissed. Back then, HP was THE most innovative company of that time. Most of us have amazing ideas for improving our company’s products or culture. After enough rejections, most of us start believing that we just weren’t born to be great and charismatic communicators, or that our managers are stupid. Feeling unheard and uninfluential quickly leads us to frustration and in-effectiveness. But the truth is that these ideas are missed because they are trapped inside the minds of people who just never got the chance to develop the required skill-set (specifically, it is true not only for “new” ideas but also to everyday things like persuading your teammates to prioritize the tasks at hand differently). 

[Go Public](https://www.facebook.com/GoPublicIL/) was born when I was trying to find a “learning community” that will enable me to PRACTICE these skills. Since then, we have experienced significant popularity - we meet for a practice session once every 2.5 weeks. Over 100 community members and a leading mentor (Top CEOs, Public Speaking experts and more) participate in each session.

This repo is our community website.

We use a Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com). The original template is live in action at <https://volny.github.io/creative-theme-jekyll/>
